pica - high quality image resize in browser
===========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pica.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nodeca/pica)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pica.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pica)

`pica` is one more experiment with high speed javascript, from authors of
[paco](https://github.com/nodeca/pako). It does high quality images resize
in browser as fast as possible.

[__demo__](http://nodeca.github.io/pica/demo/)

If you need to resize images in modern browsers, by default, use canvas'
low quality interpolation algorythms. That's why we wrote `pica`.

- It's not as fast as canvas, but still reasonably fast. With Lanczos filter and
  `window=3`, and huge image 5000x3000px resize takes ~1s on desktop and ~3s on
  mobile.
- If your [browser supports Webworkers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers), pica automatically uses it to avoid
  interface freeze.

Why it's useful:

- reduce upload size for big images to pre-process in browser, saving time and bandwidth
- save server resources for image processing
- [HiDPI image technique](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/high-dpi/#toc-tech-overview) for responsive and retna
- download single image for both thumbnail and detail-zoom


Prior to use
------------

Pica is a low level library that does math with minimal wrappers. If you need to
resize binary image, you should care about load it into canvas first (and about
saving it back to blob). Here is a short list of problems you can face with:

- Load image:
  - Due JS security restrictions, you can load to canvas only images from the same
    domain or local files. Or if you get image from remote domain with proper
    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.
  - iOS has resources limits for canvas size & image size. See
    https://github.com/stomita/ios-imagefile-megapixel for details and possible
    solutions.
  - If you plan to show image on screen after load, you must parse `exif` header
    to get proper orientation. Image can be rotated.
- Save image:
  - Some ancient browsers do not support `.toBlob()` method, use
    https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob if needed.
  - It's a good idea to keep `exif` data, to avoid palette & rotation info
    loss. The most simple way is to cut original header and glue it to resized
    result. See
    https://github.com/nodeca/nodeca.users/blob/master/client/users/uploader/uploader.js
    for example.
- Quality
  - JS canvas does not support access to info about gamma correction. Bitmaps
    have 8 bits per channel. That cause some quality loss, because with gamma
    correction precision could be 12 bits per channel.
  - Precision loss will not be noticeable for ortinary images like kittens,
    selfies and so on. But we don't recommend this library to resize images of
    professional quality.


Install
-------

node.js (to develop, build via browserify and so on):

```bash
npm install pica
```

bower:

```bash
bower install pica
```


API
---

### .resizeCanvas(options, callback)

Resize image from one canvas to another. Sizes are taken from canvas.

- __from__ - source canvas.
- __to__ - destination canvas.
- __options__ - quality (number) or object:
  - __quality__ - 0..3. Default = `3` (lanczos, win=3).
  - __alpha__ - use alpha channel. Default = `false`.
  - __unsharpAmount__ - 0..500. Default = `0` (off). Usually between 50 to 100 is good.
  - __unsharpThreshold__ - 0..100. Default = `0`. Try 10 as starting point.
- __callback(err)__ - function to call after resize complete:
  - __err__ - error if happened

__(!)__ If WebWorker available, it's returned as function result (not via
  callback) to allow early termination.


### .resizeBuffer(options, callback)

Async resize Uint8Array with raw RGBA bitmap (don't confuse with jpeg / png  / ...
binaries).

- __options:__
  - __src__ - Uint8Array with source data.
  - __width__ - src image width.
  - __height__ - src image height.
  - __toWidth__ - output width.
  - __toHeigh__ - output height.
  - __quality__ - 0..3. Default = `3` (lanczos, win=3).
  - __alpha__ - use alpha channel. Default = `false`.
  - __unsharpAmount__ - 0..500. Default = `0` (off). Usually between 50 to 100 is good.
  - __unsharpThreshold__ - 0..100. Default = `0`. Try 10 as starting point.
  - __dest__ - Optional. Output buffer to write data. Help to avoid data copy
    if no WebWorkers available. Callback will return result buffer anyway.
  - __transferable__ - Optional. Default = `false`. Whether to use
    [transferable objects](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2011/12/Transferable-Objects-Lightning-Fast).
    with webworkers. Can be faster sometime, but you cannot use the source buffer afterward.
- __callback(err, output)__ - function to call after resize complete:
  - __err__ - error if happened.
  - __output__ - Uint8Array with resized RGBA image data.

__(!)__ If WebWorker available, it's returned as function result (not via
  callback) to allow early termination.


### .WW - true/false

`true` if [webworkers are supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers).  You can use it for capabilities detection.
Also, you can set it `false` for debuging, so pica will use direct function calls.


### What is quality

Pica has presets, to adjust speed/quality ratio. Simply use `quality` option param:

- 0 - Box filter, window 0.5px
- 1 - Hamming filter, window 1.0px
- 2 - Lanczos filter, window 2.0px
- 3 - Lanczos filter, window 3.0px


### Unsharp mask

Pica has built in unsharp mask, similar to photoshop, but limited with
radius 1.0. It's off by default. Set `unsharpAmount` and `unsharpThresold`
to activate filter.


Browsers support
----------------

We had no time to test all possible combinations, but in general:

- Top level API should work in all browsers, [supporing canvas](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)
  and [typed arrays](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays).
- [Webworkers support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers) is not needed, but those will be used if available.
- If you plan to use only pure math core, then [typed arrays support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays)
  will be enougth.

__Note.__ Though you can run this package on `node.js`, browsers are the main target platform.
On server side we recommend to use GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick for better speed.
